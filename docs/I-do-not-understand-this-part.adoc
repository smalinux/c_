```
In the previous example, we have three string literals and two compound literals.
These are all object literals, and they are read-only: string literals are read-only by definition, and the two compound literals are const-qualified. Four of them have exactly the
same base type and content ('e', 'n', 'd', '\0'), so the four pointers c, d, f, and g
may all be initialized to the same address of one char array. The compiler may even save
more memory: this address may just be &e[3], by using the fact that end appears at the
end of friend.
