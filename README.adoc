hi

The word is "compound assignment".
And the full list of compound assignment operators is *= /= &= += -= <<= >>= &= ^= |=.
One of those two &=s was supposed to be %=.
(Of course you could have just written `j = j << 2` too.)
```


```
i have a basic statement like this for(int j = 0x10; j <= HEARTS + 1; j << 2) {
and i'd like to bitshift j each time
but the compiler warns that j << 2 does nothing

because:
you need a equal sign
j <<= 2
or
j = j << 2
```

### GNU C extension not a C standard...

pragma-: yes, i wont use any GNU extensions unless absolutely necessary..

sometimes the only documentation available for you is the codebase!

what that mean ??!!
